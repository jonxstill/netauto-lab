# netauto-lab: Network Automation Lab for @ipspace's Network Automation Solutions course.

The lab is based on the following software:
* Arista vEOS
* Ubuntu
* Vagrant
* VirtualBox
* Ansible

The network design is a basic leaf/spine topology that will be built entirely using eBGP peerings.

The entire lab is running on an Intel NUC with internal 120GB SSD and 16GB of RAM.

It's quite likely that I'll use a 2nd NIC running ESXi to run up a VIRL lab at some point as my day job is still Cisco everywhere...
